# Travel Bloom

## What
A pretend-website to look for holiday spots.

## Why 
It was the final project of the Javascript course (course number 4 of 11) from IBM's Backend JS Certification hosted on Coursera.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- NeoVim
- Brave Browser

## What to improve
As my main focus is to learn the backend, I didn't spend too much time making the site too pretty or selecting the best pictures.

If I wanted to improve it I could:
- add more media queries
- refactor the javascript file
- select better pictures/fonts etc.
